<h1>Top Movies According to Kunal</h1>
<h2>My best 3 Movies/Series of all Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Glory</h3>
<p>
  It's thrilling, gripping, deeply unnerving, and offers a catharsis that only
  good revenge stories can. While The Glory isn't quite as dark as we
  anticipated it to be, there's still a lot of moments when Dong-eun's revenge
  plan is at the forefront of the action, which is where the show is at its
  best.

<h3>Transformers(All parts)</h3>
<p>
  The fate of humanity is at stake when two races of robots, the good Autobots
  and the villainous Decepticons, bring their war to Earth. The robots have the
  ability to change into different mechanical objects as they seek the key to
  ultimate power.

<br />
<h3>The Nun</h3>
<p>
  This film is probably scary for impressionable teenagers, because it certainly
  isn't for mature audiences. There are descriptions of suicide, lots of blood,
  slashed skin, stabbing, dead bodies, burning bodies, a man is buried alive
  (but escapes), shooting, demonic possession and all that stuff
